# Airbnb clone
A full-stack clone of Airbnb. Features user authentication, property listings, and booking management. This project was created with React + Vite, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express. <br>
The project took around 12 hours to develop, with an additional 4 hours during application week. <br>
The deployment doesn't seem to be working on other computers so [here](https://silver-centaur-bf611e.netlify.app/) is a link to a video of the website!
